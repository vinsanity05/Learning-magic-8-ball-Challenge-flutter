# Magic 8 Ball ðŸŽ±

## The goal

The objective of this challenge is to solidify what I've learn't in the Dice tutorial. This app will guide me through the steps required to build an 8 ball app and will be applying what I have learnt about Stateless and Stateful Flutter widgets.

## What I will create

I will make a magical 8 ball app, it will give the answers to all the tricky questions in life. Also it can make the ball change at the press of a button.

## Final outcome
